# Motivation

This program is intended to provide a safe algorithm for banks to interact with customers. Customers request and release resources from the bank. The banker will keep track of the resources. The banker will grant a request if it satisfies the safety algorithm. If a request does not leave the system in a safe state, the banker will deny it.

---

# Installation

This program is compiled with the eclipse compiler and tested and run under the Linux system environment using the VirtualBox virtual machine.

---

# Screenshots

IsSafe() implements the detection function. Check whether all threads are currently in safe status.

Request() implements the thread (ie, the customer) requesting resources from the bank. The banker will grant a request if it satisfies the safety algorithm. If a request does not leave the system in a safe state, the banker will deny it.
